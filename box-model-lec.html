        <!-- MINI EXERCISE: Make a PB&J Recipe.

        >>> Don't worry with the ingredient list just yet
        >>> Place each recipe instruction inside a respective element (perhaps use <p> for each)
        >>> Create a CSS class (here and in box-model: try not to inline your CSS props if not necessary) and give it a background color
        >>> Use height/width defined in the above CSS class in order to format those elements
        >>> Place your recipe instructions inside of a container.
        >>> Define your container's box model so that it can display all of the instructions AND is centered left/right
                relative to its parent element (should be the body)
        >>> Give the container enough top margin so to separate it from the top of the body element

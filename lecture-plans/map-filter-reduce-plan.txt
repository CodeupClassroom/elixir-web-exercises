IMPORTANT: none of these functions change the original array!

all of these functions try to simply repetitive tasks on an array

all of these functions return the transformation 

all of these functions take an argument that is a function to apply to each element as the function iterates over the array, element by element

some data
const codeup = [
	{
		name: "Bob",
		age: 45,
		job: "Student"
	},
	{
		name: "Tom",
		age: 32,
		job: "Teacher"
	},
	{
		name: "Sue",
		age: 22,
		job: "Student"
	},
	{
		name: "Wilma",
		age: 37,
		job: "Teacher"
	},
	{
		name: "Zantor",
		age: 18,
		job: "Student"
	}
]

MAP 
	transform array of data into another array

compare to forEach
	var personIds = [];
	people.forEach(function (person) {
	  personIds.push(person.id);
	});

to:
	var personIds = people.map(function (person) {
  		return person.id
	});

arrow functions make it simpler:
	const personIds = people.map(person => person.id);


given an array of people objects, get an array of each person object's first name or age, or id


FILTER
	return a subset of array based on given filtering function

var students = people.filter(function (person) {
  return person.job === "Student";
});

var devs = people.filter(function (person) {
  return person.job === "Teacher";
});


REDUCE
	returns an aggregation of the array (e.g., sums, counts, averages, grouping)

const sumAges = people.reduce((acc, person) => acc + person.age, 0);

const minAge = people.reduce((minAge, person) => Math.min(person.age, minAge), Infinity);


call chaining, for even more fun!

people.filter(person => person.job === 'Teacher')
	.map(person => person.age)
	.reduce((minAge, personAge) => Math.min(personAge, minAge), Infinity);

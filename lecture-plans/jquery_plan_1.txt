console.log($.fn.jquery);

define jquery: library of js functions that work on a collection of elements that the jquery object returns


loading jquery from cdn our locally

let's follow the curriculum and download jquery uncompressed locally


window.onload = function() {
    alert( 'The page has finished loading!' );
}

demo this with a big fat image

and compare it with this:

$(document).ready(function() {
    alert( 'The DOM has finished loading!' );
});


putting our js at the bottom of the page ensures that dom will be ready when our js starts executing

---------------------

explain $
	and jQuery

All selector expressions return us a jQuery object, which is just an object that represents zero or more HTML elements, with all of the methods of jQuery attached to it.

UNLIKE querySelector and querySelectorAll


.html
	similar to .innerHTML

.css
	similar to .style

do a demo with 2 divs the id selector using:
	querySelector with one
	$ with the other div

SHOW METHOD CHAINING using 
	var myDiv = $('#div2');
	var myDivHTML = myDiv.html();

	and 

	var myDivHTML = $('#div2').html();


class selector
	copy the code samples

	play with css attributes

	show js bin

	DOES jquery .css change INLINE or EMBEDDED or both. which takes precedence?


element selector

multiple selectors

all selector
